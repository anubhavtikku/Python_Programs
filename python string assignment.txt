string assignments

1 Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.  

2 Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string.

3 Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.

4 Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.

5 Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.

6 Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.

7 Write a Python program to change a given string to a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.

8 Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.

9 Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases.
